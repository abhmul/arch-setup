# arch-setup
Setup for my computers running arch.

Additional wallpapers can be found on my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TNlT0TVXBd0uAJsXYJWkcc6zVywIOynb/view?usp=sharing). Credit goes to [Yteci](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/2alwa1/i_made_these_minimalisticish_wallpapers_and/). Unfortunately I cannot make this link public as I do not have permission from the author to reupload to a public link. These original link for the hi-res versions of these wallpapers is now dead, so I may be the one of the only people who still has a copy of the hi-res versions. Please email me at abhmul@gmail.com if you would like to access these.
